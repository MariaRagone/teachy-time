      Hi Michael, <br></br>

You made some great points about how the firearm will be used. Safety is also of huge importance, so you could also consider a strong stock and recoil pad to absorb the recoil keeping it safer for the user and avoiding damage to the gun. If the purpose is to be a showpiece hanging on your wall then any type of wood could be used for pure aesthetics.<br></br><br></br>

All of the factors are indeed necessary to design the stock in order to maximize the comfort and usability of the shooter. After planning for the gun's purpose, caliber, and recoil, its great that you thought about taking into account the user's comfort before beginning to design the stock. So the measurements are important and consider some who is smaller, younger or just learning.<br></br><br></br>

You submitted a well-formated and well-written essay.
<br></br><br></br>
There is 10% off each day later per the SDI late policy. Please remember assignments are due every Sunday.<br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>

So the measurements are important and consider some who is smaller, younger or just learning. The reason for the deduction in points is because you didn't use any outside sources. to further enhance your essay you could back up your statements with quotes from the book or other sources as the assignment asked you to do. Otherwise, you submitted a well-formatted and well-written essay.<br></br><br></br>

      <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
Hi Lonny,<br></br>

Your essay delivers a comprehensive overview of firearm drawings in gunsmithing, explaining their purposes. To further enhance your thoughts you could use specific examples or images.<br></br><br></br>

Do you have any experience in reading blueprints or other types of pictorial drawings other than for firearms?<br></br><br></br>

As an engineer, I utilized various drawings to plan designs, much like gunsmiths do to shape their client's vision and test concepts on paper, particularly in customizing jobs.<br></br><br></br>

Overall, your understanding of technical terms and the topic as a whole is evident. Your essay effectively emphasizes the significance of drawings in the gunsmithing field.<br></br><br></br>

Great job!<br></br>
