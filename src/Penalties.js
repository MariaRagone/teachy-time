<h1>Late Penalty</h1><br></br>
There is 10% off each day late per the SDI late policy. Please remember assignments are due every Sunday.<br></br><br></br>

<h1>Similarity Report</h1><br></br>

The reduction in points is due to your citations. When using a bibliography, you should cite the specific ideas or quotes from your resources within your essay. The Turnitin report shows 66% similarity with other work. I see you used the book but you need to cite the ideas within your text. If you have questions about this please let me know.<br></br><br></br>


The loss of points is due to your citations. There is a significant amount of ideas and sentences in your essay that are not cited within the essay itself. If you are using a bibliography you should be citing the specific ideas or the quotes from your resources within your essay. You should include in-text citations within the body of the essay to clearly indicate which information comes from the cited source. If you have questions about this please let me know.<br></br><br></br>

<h1>Essay Length</h1><br></br>
The reduction in points is due to your essay's length. The assignment required a minimum of 250 words, but yours is only 230. Expanding your essay will give you more space to develop your ideas further.
