Week 7 Assignments<br></br>
Hi Jacob, <br></br>
I am reaching out to you to let you know that the week 7 assignments were due yesterday. <br></br><br></br>

Please turn in your missing assignment as soon as you can to avoid further late fees of 10% per day in accordance with the SDI late policy. <br></br><br></br>

Thank you, <br></br>
