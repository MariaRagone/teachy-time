Thanks for sharing your post and a photo of your restoration project. It is beautiful. It's fascinating to hear about your experience working with different types of woods for firearm restorations! Brazilian walnut is a nice choice with its various colors and wood grains, but I completely get the practicality of going with American walnut for availability, durability, and ease of work and it also has that historical touch. It's always amazing how stains can bring out unexpected beauty in wood. Two light coats make sense for that perfect finish and adding a polyurethane warm gloss clear coat is a smart move to safeguard against scratches and dings, especially for durability. I appreciate your approach of letting customers choose the stain and whether they want a clear coat or not for their restoration. It's all about catering to individual preferences.<br></br><br></br>


It sounds like you have put a lot of thought into your wood selection of American walnut with a Dem-Bart finish. You have considered the durability, and ease of application and concluded that a classic-looking walnut stock is more appropriate than epoxy in this situation. While epoxy finishes may have many advantages, they don't always fit well with certain stock materials and firearms types. It's important to have a finish that not only looks great but also performs well and is easy to repair and touch up. <br></br><br></br>


It sounds like you have put a lot of thought into your choice of curly maple wood and finish for your reproduction of a Pennsylvania Long Rifle. I appreciate your consideration of aesthetics and a tribute to the history of the rifle. Linseed oil is a popular choice for gun stock finishes due to its ability to soak into the wood offering protection and bringing out the natural beauty of the grain. Linseed oil can take a long time to dry and can also darken over time, so it may be necessary to apply multiple coats and be patient with the drying process. I've also used beeswax in combination with English Walnut and love the finish it produced. <br></br><br></br>


It's great to hear about your appreciation for the beauty of wood in firearms and your preference for a Circassian walnut stock paired with an epoxy finish.  Walnut is a popular choice for gunstocks due to its strength, color, durability, and attractive grain.  I really like the burl grain of Circassian walnut as well and would prefer an oil finish myself to enhance the wood's natural beauty while providing protection. It deepens the wood's natural colors and the oil helps to create a barrier against moisture and dirt. I understand your preference for epoxy as it does offer a different type of resistance to the elements. It does not allow the wood to breathe like an oil finish does. Prepping the stock appropriately with sanding is key to getting the wood to accept the finish. The result of the walnut and epoxy finish combination would be a durable, beautiful, and timeless piece that can be cherished for years. <br></br><br></br>


Adding checkering to your new white ash stock can be a great way to improve the grip and enhance the overall look of the rifle. It's a traditional touch that can give your rifle a classic and refined appearance that you will definitely be able to show off and talk about since it will be your own work. Have you given any thought to taking the checkering class at SDI?<br></br><br></br>


Thanks for sharing your detailed plan for crafting a gunstock for the Ruger 10/22. It's clear you've put a lot of thought into your material and finishing choices. Using American black walnut for the stock makes sense due to its strength, durability, and availability. It is also more cost-effective when compared to other wood options. Since the Ruger 10/22 doesn't produce significant recoil, this wood should serve well without any concerns.  I've used beeswax on a walnut project before and the result was a beautiful buttery, and protective finish. Ultimately, the choice of boiled linseed oil aligns with your desired aesthetic for the firearm it also provides protection against wear and tear.  It'll give your gunstock the look you're aiming for while keeping it sturdy and well-protected.<br></br><br></br>


Your pick of Black Walnut for your Winchester Model 70 stock is solidâ€”literally and figuratively, especially given its strength and aesthetic appeal. The decision to use an epoxy finish for durability, despite its challenges in repair, shows a focus on longevity in harsh conditions, particularly during hunting trips in rugged environments. While Maple may weigh less, the visual appeal of Walnut seems to outweigh this factor for you. Your awareness of the demands placed on your firearms, including being transported in various vehicles and exposed to rough terrain, demonstrates a practical approach to stock selection and finishing. So, while epoxy might not be perfect and despite its limitations, it's the best bet for keeping your gun in tip-top shape through all your hunting escapades across the country. Overall, your attention to detail in choosing a material and finish reflects a commitment to preserving both the appearance and performance of your firearm.<br></br><br></br>
