Hi Jacob,<br></br>

Thanks for your submission for this assignment.<br></br><br></br>

Great job summarizing an essential list of tools needed for a customizing project. A band saw is a good choice for the preliminary shaping of a rough stock. Power tools should be used once you gain a little experience with shaping. It sounds like you might have a good grasp of using the tools.<br></br><br></br>

There are so many tools that will come in handy that aren't really considered essential but will make your life a whole lot easier for this project!<br></br><br></br>

As you said, I'd also recommend a suitable work area like a workbench as well as a vice to hold your work. Those are two things often overlooked as essential 'tools' and I feel that these are absolutely necessary. Good lighting is also a great idea which is usually not considered!<br></br><br></br>

Don't forget the safety equipment as well like safety glasses and ear plugs when necessary. Other tools that could be helpful are precision marking/measuring tools like digital calipers, a small level, a small L-square, and a drilling guide if you don't have a drill press.<br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>
Maria

The reason for the reduction in points is due to the length of your assignment which is only 175 words. The assignment asked for at least 250 words. This will allow you more to expand on your thoughts and explain each part of your answer more thoroughly.

Hi Joshua,<br></br><br></br>

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on stock selection for gunstocks. Choosing the right wood is a vital decision, and maple does offer some appealing qualities. Being a hardwood, it meets essential requirements for a muzzleloader gunstock, its grain patterns are considered beautiful by a lot of people, and maple is generally accessible, which is a definite advantage.<br></br><br></br>

Different types of wood possess their own aesthetically pleasing qualities, and it's a matter of finding the right sections that appeal to you. In terms of availability, it's fortunate that maple is fairly obtainable.<br></br><br></br>

Walnut is very durable as well and I like the color but the price is extremely high when compared to maple.<br></br><br></br>

The reduction in points is due to your citations. If you are using a bibliography you should be citing the specific ideas or the quotes from your resources within your essay. If you have questions about this please let me know.<br></br><br></br>

The reduction in points is due to your citations. When using a bibliography, you should cite the specific ideas or quotes from your resources within your essay. The Turnitin report shows 66% similarity with other work. I see you used the book but you need to cite the ideas within your text. If you have questions about this please let me know.<br></br><br></br>

What type of finish do you think you'd use for your maple stock?

Thanks,<br></br>
Maria

Although you provided a good argument for why someone might choose maple, the reduction in points is because you didn't answer the question in the prompt "Would you want to choose maple as your wood choice?"<br></br><br></br>

Walnut is very durable as well and I like the color but the price is high when compared to maple. It does have a historical appeal and track record.<br></br><br></br>

What type of finish do you think you'd use for your walnut stock?<br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>
