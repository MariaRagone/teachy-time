Dakota,<br></br>

Excellent comprehension of the topics for this assignment.<br></br><br></br>
Your summaries are not only thorough but also presented in a thoughtful and organized way which showcases your comprehension of the material.<br></br><br></br>

Repointing the checkering- You'd want to start the process with a thorough cleaning which is a good practice, and then deepen the checkering lines if necessary as well.<br></br><br></br>

Staining would also need a protective coating of some kinda. A protective coating is essential to ensure the longevity of the finish. Whether you opt for a stain or an oil finish, both choices require a protective layer to shield the stock from normal wear, humidity, etc., and maintain its aesthetic appeal over time.<br></br><br></br>

Please let me know if you have any questions.<br></br><br></br>

Have a great week.<br></br><br></br>

Hi Joshua,<br></br><br></br>

Impressive craftsmanship on the stockâ€”it's truly coming together beautifully. The reason for the 10-point reduction in points is because you didn't include enough photos of the shaping of the stock, I can only see a small sliver of the stock in the last photo and cannot tell if the comb is shaped.<br></br><br></br>

Have you had an opportunity to test the trigger to ensure everything functions smoothly?<br></br><br></br>

Your shaping skills are excellent. Great work with inletting the trigger guard, it looks like it is fitting well. You can adjust the shape of the comb further to your specs.<br></br><br></br>

Did you encounter any challenges with the tasks this week?<br></br><br></br>

There is a 10% late penalty for each day late per the SDI late policy.<br></br><br></br>

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.<br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>
Maria
