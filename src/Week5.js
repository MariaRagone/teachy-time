<h1>Assignment 1</h1><br></br>


Hi Aaron,<br></br>

Thanks for your submission for this assignment.<br></br><br></br>

Yes, the preferred material for butt plates is steel for its ability to take recoil and for its strength and durability.<br></br><br></br>

An adjustable butt plate is useful to use with different shooters you are teaching as well as for comfort as you said. They would also be useful on a firearm for when someone is wearing different clothing depending on the season, a younger/smaller person, or for a new marksman.
<br></br><br></br>
Great job explaining how to fit the butt plate.<br></br><br></br>

What is your preferred style or material for the butt plate?<br></br><br></br>

thanks,<br></br>

You did not discuss if you would use an adjustable butt plate and why or why not so this is the reason for the reduction in points.<br></br><br></br>

There is a 10% penalty for each day late per the SDI late policy.<br></br><br></br>

There is no late penalty per our emails. Glad your pup found her way back home!


<h1>Lab:</h1>

The reduction in points is because you did not show photos of the holes drilled through the tenons so I cannot tell if this step was done or measured correctly<br></br><br></br>


Hi Matthew,<br></br>

Great job with the tasks this week and for providing the integrity check. Although drilling the holes can be quite nerve-wracking, it seems like you took great care in ensuring the measurements were accurate by double and triple checking them.<br></br><br></br>

Overall, your photos indicate that you put in a lot of effort and care into completing all the steps, and your work looks beautiful. It takes a considerable amount of time to master these skills, but it seems like you have a good understanding of the tasks for this week.<br></br><br></br>

How do you feel about the process this week? Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions.<br></br><br></br>

Have a great weekend.<br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>

The reduction in points is because you did not show photos of the work with the tenons, tenons installed, or the holes drilled through the tenons so I cannot tell if this steps were done or measured correctly<br></br><br></br>
