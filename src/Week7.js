      Week 7 Lab<br></br><br></br>


Hi Matthew,<br></br><br></br>


The steps you took this week are impressive. The stock looks exceptionally smooth. But you did not show any evidence of the screws being countersunk which was a part of this week's assignment and the reason for the reduction in points.<br></br><br></br>

The steps you took this week are impressive. The stock looks exceptionally smooth. It appears your screws on the nose cap sit flush like they should.<br></br><br></br>

How did your stock sanding go? I suggest that you try wetting the entire stock with a spray bottle or damp rag to raise the grain before completing the final sanding. This method will help you achieve an even smoother finish.<br></br><br></br>

Did you need to remove any dents from the stock? It is amazing how easily dents can be raised with some steam.<br></br><br></br>

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any further inquiries.<br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>

The steps you took this week are impressive. The stock looks exceptionally smooth, and the screws seem to be countersunk perfectly flush with the metal on the nose cap.<br></br><br></br>

 It appears that you should work to countersink your screws a bit more on the nosecap.<br></br><br></br>


There is a 10% late penalty for each day late per the SDI late policy.

It looks like you are making nice progress on your stock. But you did not show any evidence of the screws being countersunk which was a part of this week's assignment and the reason for the reduction in 8 points. There are also not enough photos of the stock for me to determine if the sanding and shaping was done. So this is the reason for a reduction in 15 points.<br></br><br></br>
