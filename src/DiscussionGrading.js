Hi Matthew,<br></br>

Thanks for your active participation in the Week 8 discussion board. Your original post and the two insightful comments you contributed truly enriched the discussion, keeping the conversation engaging and valuable. Keep up the great work!<br></br><br></br>


There is 10% off each day the original post is late. Please remember it is due every Wednesday.<br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>

Hi Jonathon,<br></br><br></br>

Thank you for your original post on the week 6 discussion board. Your original post and the two insightful comments you contributed added value to the discussion and continued the conversation.<br></br><br></br>

You are missing the 2 comments on your classmates' posts so this is the reason for the reduction in points. Please remember they are due every Sunday. <br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>

You are missing the original post so this is the reason for the reduction in points. Please remember they are due every Wednesday and can be submitted late until Sunday for a 10% penalty for each day late. <br></br><br></br>


Your comment on a classmate's post is quite brief, which is why points were deducted. To enhance your posts, remember to evaluate any similarities or differences, offer insights into the respondents' observations, or ask questions to further the discussion. Adding more depth will enrich the value of your contributions.
