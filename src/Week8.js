Hi Matthew,<br></br>

Part 1 - Submit at least ten (10) hi-resolution images: You did not provide a video of the function check of the lock components so this is the reason for the 6 point reduction. All other photos look good.<br></br><br></br>

Part 2 - Narrate the procedure: Thanks for narrating your process for working on your kit in this class. Inletting is one of the most challenging part for most woodworkers because it is easy to make a mistake or remove too much wood. Taking your time is key and allowing enough time for a the project and starting as early as possible is helpful. Measuring andd rilling is also a challenging task for students. Everything came out great though. This is all a learning experience and you need to go through the process to learn and get a lot of practice in!<br></br><br></br>


Part 3 - Evaluate your learning experience: I'm glad to hear that you have learned a lot from this course! It is a great sense of accomplishment to see your own finished work. And for me, I am especially proud of projects that I can use or display.<br></br><br></br>


Hopefully, you will get the chance to finish your stock and use the barrel bedding. I'm glad that you feel comfortable with the skills you've learned and applied so far.<br></br><br></br>

It has been great having you as part of this course.<br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>
Maria<br></br><br></br>

<b> Assignment 1</b><br></br><br></br>
Hi Matthew,<br></br><br></br>

Thank you for submitting your assignment. I'm glad to hear that you have confidence in your skills and expertise. As a responsible gunstock designer, it's important for you to ask customers a series of questions to ensure that the custom firearm would meet their needs and expectations.<br></br><br></br>

By asking questions such as the purpose of the firearm and where it will be stored, you can help them make informed decisions about the stock design and help them choose the right tools for the project. This will ensure that the final product not only looks great but also functions effectively and safely.<br></br><br></br>

I'm glad to see that you've acquired a lot of knowledge from the course. It's always rewarding to see students like you apply what you've learned and make progress in your projects.<br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>
Maria
