Hi Corey,<br></br>

Your summary of the steps involved in inletting and overall fitting was well-done and showed a solid understanding of the process.<br></br><br></br>

Great job explaining the importance of doing metalwork before inletting. Treating and filing the metal to eliminate any burrs on the metal left from the manufacturing process is also a good idea. This will change the shape of the metal slightly so it needs to be done before inletting.<br></br><br></br>

Proceeding slowly and cautiously while inletting to avoid ruining the stock blank is important. One tip I would suggest is to switch to sanding paper when you're working within 1/16th of the correct depth, as this will help prevent accidentally removing too much material.<br></br><br></br>

Additionally, when applying stain, be sure to work with the grain of the wood to avoid any potential issues with the finish.<br></br><br></br>

Keep up the good work!<br></br><br></br>

Thanks,<br></br>
Maria
